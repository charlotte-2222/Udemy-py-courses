## Take-aways


#### Four terms
- O(n^2) Loop within a loop
- O(n) Proportional
- O(log n) Divide and conquer
- O(1) Constant time

The big-O cheat sheet will be super helpful for my writing during this course, and later on.

### Goals:
I will need to be (trying) to write out these algorithims every day for at least 30 days,
for memory commitment reasons.

While this course is in depth, and has assignments / quizzes, interview related info, it is rather short (<60hrs).
