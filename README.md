  <i>Data Structures & Algorithims<br>2022 Mastery Course</i></h1>

<div> 
  <h3>Why I'm doing this:</h3>
  <p>I primarily code in Python, however am self-taught. Therefore I lack a solid foundation in many areas, especially Data Structures & Algorithims.</p>
  <p>Taking and completing these courses should make me a better python dev, and overall improve my abilities across all languages.</p>
  
  <h3>Why a repo:</h3>
  <p>This is simply to serve as a hub for my notes & various code repos that coorespond to the courses.</p>
  <p>It is likely that most of this will be written with markdown</p>
